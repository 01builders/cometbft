-- `[light]` Fixed an edge case where a light client would panic when attempting
-  to query a node that (1) has started from a non-zero height and (2) does
-  not yet have any data. The light client will now, correctly, not panic
-  _and_ keep the node in its list of providers in the same way it would if
-  it queried a node starting from height zero that does not yet have data
-  ([\#575](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/575))
