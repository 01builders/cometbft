+celestia-core is a fork of [cometbft/cometbft](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft), an implementation of the Tendermint protocol, with the following changes:

+1. Early adoption of the ABCI++ methods: `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` because they haven't yet landed in a CometBFT release.
+1. Modifications to how `DataHash` in the block header is determined. In CometBFT, `DataHash` is based on the transactions included in a block. In Celestia, block data (including transactions) are erasure coded into a data square to enable data availability sampling. In order for the header to contain a commitment to this data square, `DataHash` was modified to be the Merkle root of the row and column roots of the erasure coded data square. See [ADR 008](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-core/blob/v0.34.x-celestia/docs/celestia-architecture/adr-008-updating-to-tendermint-v0.35.x.md?plain=1#L20) for the motivation or [celestia-app/pkg/da/data_availability_header.go](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/2f89956b22c4c3cfdec19b3b8601095af6f69804/pkg/da/data_availability_header.go) for the implementation. Note on the implementation: celestia-app computes the hash in prepare_proposal and returns it to CometBFT via [`blockData.Hash`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/5bbdac2d3f46662a34b2111602b8f964d6e6fba5/app/prepare_proposal.go#L78) so a modification to celestia-core isn't strictly necessary but [comments](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-core/blob/2ec23f804691afc196d0104616e6c880d4c1ca41/types/block.go#L1041-L1042) were added.
 
-CometBFT is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a
-state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely
-replicates it on many machines.
 
-It is a fork of [Tendermint Core][tm-core] and implements the Tendermint
-consensus algorithm.
+See [./docs/celestia-architecture](./docs/celestia-architecture/) for architecture decision records (ADRs) on Celestia modifications.
 
-For protocol details, refer to the [CometBFT Specification](./spec/README.md).

+## Branches
 
-Before contributing to the project, please take a look at the [contributing
-guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [style guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md). You may also

+The canonical branches in this repo are based on CometBFT releases. For example: [`v0.34.x-celestia`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-core/tree/v0.34.x-celestia) is based on the CometBFT `v0.34.x` release branch and contains Celestia-specific changes.
 
 ## Versioning
 
-### Semantic Versioning
-
-CometBFT uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) to determine when and
-how the version changes. According to SemVer, anything in the public API can
-change at any time before version 1.0.0
-
-To provide some stability to users of 0.X.X versions of CometBFT, the MINOR
-version is used to signal breaking changes across CometBFT's API. This API
-includes all publicly exposed types, functions, and methods in non-internal Go
-packages as well as the types and methods accessible via the CometBFT RPC
-interface.
-
-Breaking changes to these public APIs will be documented in the CHANGELOG.
-
-### Upgrades
-
-In an effort to avoid accumulating technical debt prior to 1.0.0, we do not
-guarantee that breaking changes (i.e. bumps in the MINOR version) will work with
-existing CometBFT blockchains. In these cases you will have to start a new
-blockchain, or write something custom to get the old data into the new chain.
-However, any bump in the PATCH version should be compatible with existing
-blockchain histories.
-
-For more information on upgrading, see [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md).
-
-### Supported Versions
-
-Because we are a small core team, we have limited capacity to ship patch
-updates, including security updates. Consequently, we strongly recommend keeping
-CometBFT up-to-date. Upgrading instructions can be found in
-[UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md).
-
-Currently supported versions include:
-
-- v0.34.x: The CometBFT v0.34 series is compatible with the Tendermint Core
-  v0.34 series
-- v0.37.x: (release candidate)
-
