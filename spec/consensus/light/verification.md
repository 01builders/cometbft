# Lite client

A lite client is a process that connects to Tendermint full node(s) and then tries to verify application
data using the Merkle proofs.

## Problem statement

We assume that the lite client knows a (base) header *inithead* it trusts (by social consensus or because
the lite client has decided to trust the header before). The goal is to check whether another header
*newhead* can be trusted based on the data in *inithead*.

The correctness of the protocol is based on the assumption that *inithead* was generated by an instance of
Tendermint consensus.

## Definitions

### Data structures

In the following, only the details of the data structures needed for this specification are given.

 ```go
   type Header struct {
        Height               int64
        Time                 Time          // the chain time when the header (block) was generated
        ValidatorsHash       []byte        // hash of the validators for the current block
        NextValidatorsHash   []byte        // hash of the validators for the next block
   }

   type SignedHeader struct {
        Header        Header
        Commit        Commit            // commit for the given header
   }

   type ValidatorSet struct {
        Validators         []Validator
        TotalVotingPower   int64
   }

   type Validator struct {
        Address       Address           // validator address (we assume validator's addresses are unique)
        VotingPower   int64             // validator's voting power
   }

   type TrustedState {
        SignedHeader   SignedHeader
        ValidatorSet   ValidatorSet
   }
 ```

### Functions

For the purpose of this lite client specification, we assume that the Tendermint Full Node exposes the following functions over Tendermint RPC:
```go
    // returns signed header: Header with Commit, for the given height
    func Commit(height int64) (SignedHeader, error)

    // returns validator set for the given height
    func Validators(height int64) (ValidatorSet, error)
```

Furthermore, we assume the following auxiliary functions:
```go
    // returns true if the commit is for the header, ie. if it contains
    // the correct hash of the header; otherwise false
    func matchingCommit(header Header, commit Commit) bool

    // returns the set of validators from the given validator set that
    // committed the block (that correctly signed the block)
    // it assumes signature verification so it can be computationally expensive
    func signers(commit Commit, validatorSet ValidatorSet) []Validator

    // return the voting power the validators in v1 have according to their voting power in set v2
    // it does not assume signature verification
    func votingPowerIn(v1 []Validator, v2 ValidatorSet) int64

    // returns hash of the given validator set
    func hash(v2 ValidatorSet) []byte
```

### Failure Model

For the purpose of model definitions we assume that there exists a function
`validators` that returns the corresponding validator set for the given hash.
The lite client specification is defined with respect to the following failure model:

Given a known bound `TRUSTED_PERIOD`, and a block `b` with header `h` generated at time `Time`
(i.e. `h.Time = Time`), a set of validators that hold more than 2/3 of the voting power
in `validators(b.Header.NextValidatorsHash)` is correct until time `b.Header.Time + TRUSTED_PERIOD`.

*Assumption*: "correct" is defined w.r.t. realtime (some Newtonian global notion of time, i.e., wall time),
while `Header.Time` corresponds to the [BFT time](bft-time.md). In this note, we assume that clocks of correct processes
are synchronized (for example using NTP), and therefore there is bounded clock drift (`CLOCK_DRIFT`) between local clocks and
BFT time. More precisely, for every correct lite client process and every `header.Time` (i.e. BFT Time, for a header correctly
generated by the Tendermint consensus), the following inequality holds: `Header.Time < now + CLOCK_DRIFT`,
where `now` corresponds to the system clock at the lite client process.

Furthermore, we assume that `TRUSTED_PERIOD` is (several) order of magnitude bigger than `CLOCK_DRIFT` (`TRUSTED_PERIOD >> CLOCK_DRIFT`),
as `CLOCK_DRIFT` (using NTP) is in the order of milliseconds and `TRUSTED_PERIOD` is in the order of weeks.

We expect a lite client process defined in this document to be used in the context in which there is some
larger period during which misbehaving validators can be detected and punished (we normally refer to it as `PUNISHMENT_PERIOD`).
Furthermore, we assume that `TRUSTED_PERIOD < PUNISHMENT_PERIOD` and that they are normally of the same order of magnitude, for example
`TRUSTED_PERIOD = PUNISHMENT_PERIOD / 2`. Note that `PUNISHMENT_PERIOD` is often referred to as an
unbonding period due to the "bonding" mechanism in modern proof of stake systems.

The specification in this document considers an implementation of the lite client under the Failure Model defined above.
Mechanisms like `fork accountability` and `evidence submission` are defined in the context of `PUNISHMENT_PERIOD` and
they incentivize validators to follow the protocol specification defined in this document. If they don't,
and we have 1/3 (or more) faulty validators, safety may be violated. Our approach then is
to *detect* these cases (after the fact), and take suitable repair actions (automatic and social).
This is discussed in document on [Fork accountability](fork-accountability.md).

*Remark*: This failure model might change to a hybrid version that takes heights into account in the future.

### Functions

In the functions below we will be using `trustThreshold` as a parameter. For simplicity
we assume that `trustThreshold` is a float between 1/3 and 2/3 and we will not be checking it
in the pseudo-code.

**VerifySingle.** The function `VerifySingle` attempts to validate given untrusted header and the corresponding validator sets
based on a given trusted state. It ensures that the trusted state is still within its trusted period,
and that the untrusted header is within assume `clockDrift` bound of the passed time `now`.
Note that this function is not making external (RPC) calls to the full node; the whole logic is
based on the local (given) state. This function is supposed to be used by the IBC handlers.

```go
func VerifySingle(untrustedSh SignedHeader,
                  untrustedVs ValidatorSet,
                  untrustedNextVs ValidatorSet,
                  trustedState TrustedState,
                  trustThreshold float,
                  trustingPeriod Duration,
                  clockDrift Duration,
                  now Time) (TrustedState, error) {

    if untrustedSh.Header.Time > now + clockDrift {
        return (trustedState, ErrInvalidHeaderTime)
    }

    trustedHeader = trustedState.SignedHeader.Header
    if !isWithinTrustedPeriod(trustedHeader, trustingPeriod, now) {
        return (state, ErrHeaderNotWithinTrustedPeriod)
    }

    // we assume that time it takes to execute verifySingle function
    // is several order of magnitudes smaller than trustingPeriod
    error = verifySingle(
                trustedState,
                untrustedSh,
                untrustedVs,
                untrustedNextVs,
                trustThreshold)

    if error != nil return (state, error)

    // the untrusted header is now trusted
    newTrustedState = TrustedState(untrustedSh, untrustedNextVs)
    return (newTrustedState, nil)
}

// return true if header is within its lite client trusted period; otherwise returns false
func isWithinTrustedPeriod(header Header,
                           trustingPeriod Duration,
                           now Time) bool {

    return header.Time + trustedPeriod > now
}
```

Note that in case `VerifySingle` returns without an error (untrusted header
is successfully verified) then we have a guarantee that the transition of the trust
from `trustedState` to `newTrustedState` happened during the trusted period of
`trustedState.SignedHeader.Header`.


**verifySingle.** The function `verifySingle` verifies a single untrusted header
against a given trusted state. It includes all validations and signature verification.
It is not publicly exposed since it does not check for header expiry (time constraints)
and hence it's possible to use it incorrectly.

```go
func verifySingle(trustedState TrustedState,
                  untrustedSh SignedHeader,
                  untrustedVs ValidatorSet,
                  untrustedNextVs ValidatorSet,
                  trustThreshold float) error {

    untrustedHeader = untrustedSh.Header
    untrustedCommit = untrustedSh.Commit

    trustedHeader = trustedState.SignedHeader.Header
    trustedVs = trustedState.ValidatorSet

    if trustedHeader.Height >= untrustedHeader.Height return ErrNonIncreasingHeight
    if trustedHeader.Time >= untrustedHeader.Time return ErrNonIncreasingTime

    // validate the untrusted header against its commit, vals, and next_vals
    error = validateSignedHeaderAndVals(untrustedSh, untrustedVs, untrustedNextVs)
    if error != nil return error

    // check for adjacent headers
    if untrustedHeader.Height == trustedHeader.Height + 1 {
        if trustedHeader.NextValidatorsHash != untrustedHeader.ValidatorsHash {
            return ErrInvalidAdjacentHeaders
        }
    } else {
        error = verifyCommitTrusting(trustedVs, untrustedCommit, untrustedVs, trustThreshold)
        if error != nil return error
    }

    // verify the untrusted commit
    return verifyCommitFull(untrustedVs, untrustedCommit)
}

// returns nil if header and validator sets are consistent; otherwise returns error
func validateSignedHeaderAndVals(signedHeader SignedHeader, vs ValidatorSet, nextVs ValidatorSet) error {
    header = signedHeader.Header
    if hash(vs) != header.ValidatorsHash return ErrInvalidValidatorSet
    if hash(nextVs) != header.NextValidatorsHash return ErrInvalidNextValidatorSet
    if !matchingCommit(header, signedHeader.Commit) return ErrInvalidCommitValue
    return nil
}

// returns nil if at least single correst signer signed the commit; otherwise returns error
func verifyCommitTrusting(trustedVs ValidatorSet,
                          commit Commit,
                          untrustedVs ValidatorSet,
                          trustLevel float) error {

    totalPower := trustedVs.TotalVotingPower
    signedPower := votingPowerIn(signers(commit, untrustedVs), trustedVs)

    // check that the signers account for more than max(1/3, trustLevel) of the voting power
    // this ensures that there is at least single correct validator in the set of signers
    if signedPower < max(1/3, trustLevel) * totalPower return ErrInsufficientVotingPower
    return nil
}

// returns nil if commit is signed by more than 2/3 of voting power of the given validator set
// return error otherwise
func verifyCommitFull(vs ValidatorSet, commit Commit) error {
    totalPower := vs.TotalVotingPower;
    signedPower := votingPowerIn(signers(commit, vs), vs)

    // check the signers account for +2/3 of the voting power
    if signedPower * 3 <= totalPower * 2 return ErrInvalidCommit
    return nil
}
```

**VerifyHeaderAtHeight.** The function `VerifyHeaderAtHeight` captures high level
logic, i.e., application call to the lite client module to download and verify header
for some height.

```go
func VerifyHeaderAtHeight(untrustedHeight int64,
                          trustedState TrustedState,
                          trustThreshold float,
                          trustingPeriod Duration,
                          clockDrift Duration) (TrustedState, error)) {

    trustedHeader := trustedState.SignedHeader.Header

    now := System.Time()
    if !isWithinTrustedPeriod(trustedHeader, trustingPeriod, now) {
        return (trustedState, ErrHeaderNotWithinTrustedPeriod)
    }

    newTrustedState, err := VerifyBisection(untrustedHeight,
                                            trustedState,
                                            trustThreshold,
                                            trustingPeriod,
                                            clockDrift,
                                            now)

    if err != nil return (trustedState, err)

    now = System.Time()
    if !isWithinTrustedPeriod(trustedHeader, trustingPeriod, now) {
        return (trustedState, ErrHeaderNotWithinTrustedPeriod)
    }

    return (newTrustedState, err)
}
```

Note that in case `VerifyHeaderAtHeight` returns without an error (untrusted header
is successfully verified) then we have a guarantee that the transition of the trust
from `trustedState` to `newTrustedState` happened during the trusted period of
`trustedState.SignedHeader.Header`.

**VerifyBisection.** The function `VerifyBisection` implements
recursive logic for checking if it is possible building trust
relationship between `trustedState` and untrusted header at the given height over
finite set of (downloaded and verified) headers.

```go
func VerifyBisection(untrustedHeight int64,
                     trustedState TrustedState,
                     trustThreshold float,
                     trustingPeriod Duration,
                     clockDrift Duration,
                     now Time) (TrustedState, error) {

    untrustedSh, error := Commit(untrustedHeight)
    if error != nil return (trustedState, ErrRequestFailed)

    untrustedHeader = untrustedSh.Header

    // note that we pass now during the recursive calls. This is fine as
    // all other untrusted headers we download during recursion will be
    // for a smaller heights, and therefore should happen before.
    if untrustedHeader.Time > now + clockDrift {
        return (trustedState, ErrInvalidHeaderTime)
    }

    untrustedVs, error := Validators(untrustedHeight)
    if error != nil return (trustedState, ErrRequestFailed)

    untrustedNextVs, error := Validators(untrustedHeight + 1)
    if error != nil return (trustedState, ErrRequestFailed)

    error = verifySingle(
             trustedState,
             untrustedSh,
             untrustedVs,
             untrustedNextVs,
             trustThreshold)

    if fatalError(error) return (trustedState, error)

    if error == nil {
        // the untrusted header is now trusted.
        newTrustedState = TrustedState(untrustedSh, untrustedNextVs)
        return (newTrustedState, nil)
    }

    // at this point in time we need to do bisection
    pivotHeight := ceil((trustedHeader.Height + untrustedHeight) / 2)

    error, newTrustedState = VerifyBisection(pivotHeight,
                                             trustedState,
                                             trustThreshold,
                                             trustingPeriod,
                                             clockDrift,
                                             now)
    if error != nil return (newTrustedState, error)

    return VerifyBisection(untrustedHeight,
                           newTrustedState,
                           trustThreshold,
                           trustingPeriod,
                           clockDrift,
                           now)
}

func fatalError(err) bool {
    return err == ErrHeaderNotWithinTrustedPeriod OR
           err == ErrInvalidAdjacentHeaders OR
           err == ErrNonIncreasingHeight OR
           err == ErrNonIncreasingTime OR
           err == ErrInvalidValidatorSet OR
           err == ErrInvalidNextValidatorSet OR
           err == ErrInvalidCommitValue OR
           err == ErrInvalidCommit
}
```



### The case `untrusted_h.Header.height < trusted_h.Header.height`

In the use case where someone tells the lite client that application data that is relevant for it 
can be read in the block of height `k` and the lite client trusts a more recent header, we can use the 
hashes to verify headers "down the chain." That is, we iterate down the heights and check the hashes in each step.

*Remark.* For the case were the lite client trusts two headers `i` and `j` with `i < k < j`, we should 
discuss/experiment whether the forward or the backward method is more effective.

```go
func Backwards(trusted_h,untrusted_h) error {
  assert (untrusted_h.Header.height < trusted_h.Header.height)
  if !isWithinTrustedPeriod(trusted_h) return ErrHeaderNotTrusted(trusted_h)

  old := trusted_h
  for i := trusted_h.Header.height - 1; i > untrusted_h.Header.height; i-- {
    new := Commit(i)
    if (hash(new) != old.Header.hash) {
      return ErrInvalidAdjacentHeaders
    }
    old := new
    if !isWithinTrustedPeriod(trusted_h) return ErrHeaderNotTrusted(trusted_h)
  }
  if hash(untrusted_h) != old.Header.hash return ErrInvalidAdjacentHeaders
  return nil
 }
```

In order to incentivize correct behavior of validators that run Tendermint consensus protocol, fork detection protocol (it will be explained in different document) is executed in case of a fork (conflicting
headers are detected). As detecting conflicting headers, its propagation through the network (by the gossip protocol) and execution of the fork accountability
protocol on the chain takes time, the lite client logic assumes conservative value for trusted period. More precisely, in the context of lite client we always
operate with a smaller trusted period that we call *lite client trusted period* (LITE_CLIENT_TRUSTED_PERIOD). If we assume that upper bound
for fork detection, propagation and processing on the chain is denoted with *fork procession period* (FORK_PROCESSING_PERIOD), then the following formula
holds:
```LITE_CLIENT_TRUSTED_PERIOD + FORK_PROCESSING_PERIOD < TRUSTED_PERIOD```, where TRUSTED_PERIOD comes from the Tendermint Failure Model.


*Assumption*: In the following, we assume that *untrusted_h.Header.height > trusted_h.Header.height*. We will quickly discuss the other case in the next section.

We consider the following set-up:
- the lite client communicates with one full node
- the lite client locally stores all the headers that has passed basic verification and that are within lite client trust period. In the pseudo code below we
write *Store.Add(header)* for this. If a header failed to verify, then
the full node we are talking to is faulty and we should disconnect from it and reinitialise with new peer.
- If `CanTrust` returns *error*, then the lite client has seen a forged header or the trusted header has expired (it is outside its trusted period).
  * In case of forged header, the full node is faulty so lite client should disconnect and reinitialise with new peer. If the trusted header has expired,
  we need to reinitialise lite client with new trusted header (that is within its trusted period), but we don't necessarily need to disconnect from the full node
  we are talking to (as we haven't observed full node misbehavior in this case).



## Context of this document

In order to make sure that full nodes have the incentive to follow the protocol, we have to address the
following three Issues

1) The lite client needs a method to verify headers it obtains from a full node it connects to according to trust assumptions -- this document.

2) The lite client must be able to connect to other full nodes to detect and report on failures in the trust assumptions (i.e., conflicting headers) -- a future document (see #4215).

3) In the event the trust assumption fails (i.e., a lite client is fooled by a conflicting header), the Tendermint fork accountability protocol must account for the evidence -- a future document (see #3840).

The term "trusting" above indicates that the correctness of the protocol depends on
this assumption. It is in the responsibility of the user that runs the lite client to make sure that the risk
of trusting a corrupted/forged *inithead* is negligible.

* For each header *h* it has locally stored, the lite client stores whether
    it trusts *h*. We write *trust(h) = true*, if this is the case.

* signed header fields: contains a header and a  *commit* for the current header; a "seen commit".
  In Tendermint consensus the "canonical commit" is stored in header *height* + 1.


  * Validator fields. We will write a validator as a tuple *(v,p)* such that
    + *v* is the identifier (we assume identifiers are unique in each validator set)
    + *p* is its voting power

### Definitions

* *TRUSTED_PERIOD*: trusting period
* for realtime *t*, the predicate *correct(v,t)* is true if the validator *v*
  follows the protocol until time *t* (we will see about recovery later).


### Tendermint Failure Model

If a block *b* is generated at time *Time* (and this time is stored in the block), then a set of validators that
hold more than 2/3 of the voting power in ```validators(b.Header.NextValidatorsHash)``` is correct until time
```b.Header.Time + TRUSTED_PERIOD```.

Formally,
\[
\sum_{(v,p) \in h.Header.NextV \wedge correct(v,h.Header.bfttime + TRUSTED_PERIOD)} p >
2/3 \sum_{(v,p) \in h.Header.NextV} p
\]


## Lite Client Trusting Spec

The lite client communicates with a full node and learns new headers. The goal is to locally decide whether to trust a header. Our implementation needs to ensure the following two properties:

- Lite Client Completeness: If header *h* was correctly generated by an instance of Tendermint consensus (and its age is less than the trusting period), then the lite client should eventually set *trust(h)* to true.

- Lite Client Accuracy:  If header *h* was *not generated* by an instance of Tendermint consensus, then the lite client should never set *trust(h)* to true.

*Remark*: If in the course of the computation, the lite client obtains certainty that some headers were forged by adversaries (that is were not generated by an instance of Tendermint consensus), it may submit (a subset of) the headers it has seen as evidence of misbehavior.

*Remark*: In Completeness we use "eventually", while in practice *trust(h)* should be set to true before *h.Header.bfttime + tp*. If not, the block cannot be trusted because it is too old.

*Remark*: If a header *h* is marked with *trust(h)*, but it is too old (its bfttime is more than *tp* ago), then the lite client should set *trust(h)* to false again.

*Assumption*: Initially, the lite client has a header *inithead* that it trusts correctly, that is, *inithead* was correctly generated by the Tendermint consensus.

To reason about the correctness, we may prove the following invariant.

*Verification Condition: Lite Client Invariant.*
 For each lite client *l* and each header *h*:
if *l* has set *trust(h) = true*,
  then validators that are correct until time *h.Header.bfttime + tp* have more than two thirds of the voting power in *h.Header.NextV*.

  Formally,
  \[
  \sum_{(v,p) \in h.Header.NextV \wedge correct(v,h.Header.bfttime + tp)} p >
  2/3 \sum_{(v,p) \in h.Header.NextV} p
  \]

*Remark.* To prove the invariant, we will have to prove that the lite client only trusts headers that were correctly generated by Tendermint consensus, then the formula above follows from the Tendermint failure model.


## High Level Solution

Upon initialization, the lite client is given a header *inithead* it trusts (by
social consensus). It is assumed that *inithead* satisfies the lite client invariant. (If *inithead* has been correctly generated by Tendermint consensus, the invariant follows from the Tendermint Failure Model.)
Note that the *inithead* should be within its trusted period during initialization.

When a lite clients sees a signed new header *snh*, it has to decide whether to trust the new
header. Trust can be obtained by (possibly) the combination of three methods.

1. **Uninterrupted sequence of proof.** If a block is appended to the chain, where the last block
is trusted (and properly committed by the old validator set in the next block),
and the new block contains a new validator set, the new block is trusted if the lite client knows all headers in the prefix.
Intuitively, a trusted validator set is assumed to only chose a new validator set that will obey the Tendermint Failure Model.

2. **Trusting period.** Based on a trusted block *h*, and the lite client
invariant, which ensures the fault assumption during the trusting period, we can check whether at least one  validator, that has been continuously correct from *h.Header.bfttime* until now, has signed *snh*.
If this is the case, similarly to above, the chosen validator set in *snh* does not violate the Tendermint Failure Model.

3. **Bisection.** If a check according to the trusting period fails, the lite client can try to obtain a header *hp* whose height lies between *h* and *snh* in order to check whether *h* can be used to get trust for *hp*, and *hp* can be used to get trust for *snh*. If this is the case we can trust *snh*; if not, we may continue recursively.

## How to use it

We consider the following use case:
 the lite client wants to verify a header for some given height *k*. Thus:
  - it requests the signed header for height *k* from a full node
  - it tries to verify this header with the methods described here.

This can be used in several settings:
  - someone tells the lite client that application data that is relevant for it can be read in the block of height *k*.
  - the lite clients wants the latest state. It asks a full nude for the current height, and uses the response for *k*.
  - in case of inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC) the light client runs on a chain and someone feeds it
  signed headers as input and it computes whether it can trust it.


## Details

**Observation 1.** If *h.Header.bfttime + tp > now*, we trust the old
validator set *h.Header.NextV*.

When we say we trust *h.Header.NextV* we do *not* trust that each individual validator in *h.Header.NextV* is correct,
but we only trust the fact that less than 1/3 of them are faulty (more precisely, the faulty ones have less than 1/3 of the total voting power).



*Correctness arguments*

Towards Lite Client Accuracy:
- Assume by contradiction that `untrusted_h` was not generated correctly and the lite client sets trust to true because `CheckSupport` returns true.
- trusted_h is trusted and sufficiently new
- by Tendermint Fault Model, less than 1/3 of voting power held by faulty validators => at least one correct validator *v* has signed `untrusted_h`.
- as *v* is correct up to now, it followed the Tendermint consensus protocol at least up to signing `untrusted_h` => `untrusted_h` was correctly generated, we arrive at the required contradiction.


Towards Lite Client Completeness:
- The check is successful if sufficiently many validators of `trusted_h` are still validators in `untrusted_h` and signed `untrusted_h`.
- If *untrusted_h.Header.height = trusted_h.Header.height + 1*, and both headers were generated correctly, the test passes

*Verification Condition:* We may need a Tendermint invariant stating that if *untrusted_h.Header.height = trusted_h.Header.height + 1* then *signers(untrusted_h.Commit) \subseteq trusted_h.Header.NextV*.

*Remark*: The variable *trustThreshold* can be used if the user believes that relying on one correct validator is not sufficient. However, in case of (frequent) changes in the validator set, the higher the *trustThreshold* is chosen, the more unlikely it becomes that CheckSupport returns true for non-adjacent headers.




*Correctness arguments (sketch)*

Lite Client Accuracy:
- Assume by contradiction that `untrusted_h` was not generated correctly and the lite client sets trust to true because CanTrustBisection returns nil.
- CanTrustBisection returns true only if all calls to CheckSupport in the recursion return nil.
- Thus we have a sequence of headers that all satisfied the CheckSupport
- again a contradiction

Lite Client Completeness:

This is only ensured if upon *Commit(pivot)* the lite client is always provided with a correctly generated header.

*Stalling*

With CanTrustBisection, a faulty full node could stall a lite client by creating a long sequence of headers that are queried one-by-one by the lite client and look OK, before the lite client eventually detects a problem. There are several ways to address this:
* Each call to ```Commit``` could be issued to a different full node
* Instead of querying header by header, the lite client tells a full node which header it trusts, and the height of the header it needs. The full node responds with the header along with a proof consisting of intermediate headers that the light client can use to verify. Roughly, Bisection would then be executed at the full node.
* We may set a timeout how long bisection may take.
